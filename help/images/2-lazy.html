### Lazy-Loading

One of the advantages of the `<img>` component is that images can be loaded only when user scrolls them into view. This saves bandwidth and improves the loading time as the page does not have to wait for image data to be downloaded. Lazy-loading is enabled by default.

```html
<img src="img/my-img.jpg" alt="My Image" />
```

This will generate html similar to the following one:

```html
a
```

Because lazy-loading requires _JavaScript_, there's a `<noscript>` tag added next to the image placeholder, which will be displayed if the user has JS disabled.

### Above Fold

Some images will be displayed above fold, i.e. immediately visible to the user. To make sure they are loaded straight away when the page opens without waiting for _JavaScript_ to evaluate, the `above-fold` attribute should be added.

```html
<img src="img/my-img.jpg" alt="My Image" above-fold />
```

In this case, there will be no `<noscript>` tag as no _JavaScript_ is required.

```html
a
```

### Placeholder

Before the image is loaded, the browser does not know its dimensions, therefore an empty space is displayed, which once updated makes the page jump. To avoid this jumping behavior, a placeholder should be added &mdash; an empty SVG image with the dimensions of the image. This way, there is no jumping of the content.

```html
<img src="img/my-img.jpg" alt="My Image" placeholder-auto />
```

When adding the ``placeholder-auto`` attribute, _Splendid_ will look up the dimensions of the image using the image processing library and generate the placeholder. The dimensions can also be specified manually with ``placeholder-width`` and ``placeholder-height`` attributes.

```html
<img src="img/my-img.svg" alt="Photo"
  placeholder-width="300px" placeholder-height="200px" />
```

The standard technique of setting width and height on the image tag like `<img width="500" height="500" src="img/dimensions.jpg"/>` does not prevent the jumping behaviour as we've found out after testing, therefore the SVG needs to be used.
