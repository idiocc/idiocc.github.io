### Responsive WebP

_Splendid_ can generate `webp` images by calling `cwebp` on the local machine. This means that this binary needs to be installed. After that, the `webp` attribute needs to be set for automatic generation of `webp` images and the `picture` element that would display the image according to the screen resolution.

```html
<img webp="photo" src="../img/photo.jpg" alt="Picture" />
```
