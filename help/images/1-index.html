## Images

There are a number of strategies for including images, depending on the required quality (either original, or a bit lower quality but with better compression hence smaller file size using `webp`), and position on the page where they are placed.

Images are added with the standard `<img>` tag, however to enable processing by _Splendid_, the tag needs to be closed with a `/>`. If it is not closed (i.e., is written as *void* tag), the standard HTML is kept without any processing.

```html
<img src="img/example.jpg" alt="Image"/> <!-- processed -->

<img src="img/example.jpg" alt="Image"> <!-- NOT processed -->
```

###Â Alt Attribute

The `alt` attribute is essential for SEO and users with screen readers, therefore there will be a warning displayed when it is missing (on processed tags).

### Paths

When specified paths to the image begin with `.` such as `<img src="./img/example.jpg" />`, they will be resolved to the location relative to the file in which they are referenced. When there is no leading `.`, such as `<img src="img/example.jpg" />`, the path is relative to the _Splendid_ app directory.
